# Tetris
The files seem to work fine until trying to rotate the pieces when placed against a wall causing the application to crash and create errors until Q to "quit" is pressed to restart

The game works with arrow keys and the up key to rotate the pieces, the space bar casues the pieces to drop instantly.
